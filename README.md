# protein-grouping-for-high-vs-low-cirrhosis-patients
Out of the various proteins that are siginificantly present in human body, This project aims to find proteins that are significantly more in humans(patients) with higher cirrrhosis condition and those proteins that are significantly more in lower cirrhosis condition .They try to analyze distribution of proteins in both cirrhosis groups.
The Patients file contain Patient ID, Cirrhossis type (High, Low, Medium)
The Proteins file has the same content with Protein details
